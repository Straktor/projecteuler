# [Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

> 1^2+2^2+...+10^2 = 385

>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

> (1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 =3025

>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
